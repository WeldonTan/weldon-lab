# Weldon's Experiment Lab

This repo is my personal sandbox for trying out ideas — web scraping, automation, small tools, machine learning experiments, and anything else I feel like exploring.

The goal is not to be polished or perfect. It’s a place to:

- Test new libraries and tools
- Play with small concepts and prototypes
- Write quick throwaway code to learn something
- Keep a record of what I’ve tried

---

## How This Repo Is Organized

Each experiment lives in its **own folder**, usually grouped by theme. For example:

- `scraping/` – experiments related to crawling or extracting data from websites  
- `ml/` – experiments related to machine learning or data  
- `automation/` – small scripts that automate repetitive tasks  
- `notebooks/` – quick, exploratory work in notebook form

Inside each experiment folder, I usually keep:

- A small script or two for the idea
- A simple `notes.md` file describing:
  - What I was trying to do
  - What worked
  - What I might try next

---

## How I Use This Repo

- Start a new folder whenever I want to explore a fresh idea
- Keep things small and focused so I can come back later and quickly understand what I did
- Treat this as a personal lab notebook for my coding journey

## Notes to Future Me

- Don’t worry about perfection here — just experiment.
- Write down at least a few lines of notes for anything non-trivial.
- If something turns out to be really useful, it can always be moved into its own proper project later.
